# Unemployment Analysis in India using Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment trends in India and understand the impact of COVID-19 on employment using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the unemployment dataset from a CSV file.
2. Cleaned the dataset by standardizing column names and handling missing values.
3. Converted the date column into datetime format for time-series analysis.
4. Analyzed unemployment trends over time using line plots.
5. Visualized the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.
6. Performed state-wise unemployment analysis.
7. Compared unemployment trends in urban and rural areas.
8. Conducted correlation analysis between unemployment rate, employment, and labour participation rate.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data handling and analysis)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Dataset
- Unemployment in India Dataset (CSV format)
- Source: Kaggle
- Features: Region, Date, Estimated Unemployment Rate, Estimated Employed, Labour Participation Rate, Area (Urban/Rural)

## Outcome
The analysis revealed a significant increase in unemployment during the COVID-19 period. Urban areas were more affected than rural areas, and unemployment rates varied across different states. The project provided meaningful insights into employment trends and strengthened practical data analysis skills.
